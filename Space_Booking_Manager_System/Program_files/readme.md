The system is created for an institute to manage their space or rooms. The room being 
managed is lab and lecture room. The three users of the system are the admin, lecturer 
and space manager. All three user have different user level as each has their own role. 
Admins are in charge of the system, space managers manage the booking such as 
approving or declining the booking based on the availability of the room and lecturer 
books the room. The name of the system is Space Booking Management System.

**This project was developed using localhost(XAMPP Version: 8.0.6) and was not deployed to the public as instructed by our course lecturer due to the current online learning mode.
